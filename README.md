April 14, 1912.

You're on the Titanic, five minutes after the famous collision.

As it grinds against the ice, every passenger on board is looking back on each factor that led them to be on the ship at that moment.

Those same factors, now immortalized in the 887 entries of the titanic.csv dataset, will be what determines their fate in the next 24 hours.

Through stastical analysis of the dataframe, we can synthesize the exact combination of factors that maximizes that chance of surival.

And, perhaps, find the luckiest passenger on board along the way.
